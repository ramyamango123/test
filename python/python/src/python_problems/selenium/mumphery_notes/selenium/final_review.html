<li>What do DOM expressions start with (after the <b>dom=</b>)?
<!-- SOLUTION: document. -->
<p>
<li>If an <b>xpath</b> expression did not start with the <b>xpath=</b>
prefix, what would it start with?
<!-- SOLUTION: // -->
<p>
<li>What does a character class for any character except an alphabetical
letter look like?
<!-- SOLUTION: [^a-zA-Z] -->
<p>
<li>What is the difference between these two regular expressions?
<pre>
[.]*
.*
</pre>
<!-- SOLUTION: The first matches 0 or more periods, whereas
the second matches 0 or more of any character. -->
<p>
<li>How can the following regular expression be easily shortened?
<pre>
[M].*[m]
</pre>
<!-- SOLUTION: M.*m -->
<p>
<li>What is the generic name for expressions that begin with
<b>dom=</b>, <b>name=</b>, <b>xpath=</b>, and <b>id=</b>?
<!-- SOLUTION: Element locators -->
<p>
<li>What is the generic name for expressions that begin with
<b>regexp:</b>, <b>glob:</b>, and <b>exact:</b>?
<!-- SOLUTION: Patterns -->
<p>
<li>In order to use the <b>Find</b> button, what type would the first
argument for the current command have to be?
<!-- SOLUTION: An element locator -->
<p>
<li>What is the generic name for HTML entities such as <b>title=</b>,
<b>name=</b>,
<b>href=</b>, <b>id=</b>, <b>alt=</b>, etc. that are found within the
source code of a
page?
<!-- SOLUTION: Attributes -->
<p>
<li>What command simulates clicking the browser's <b>Refresh</b> button and
then waiting for the page to finish loading?
<!-- SOLUTION: refreshAndWait-->
<p>
<li>What will the Selenium reference show as the argument type when
a small piece of JavaScript code is required?
<!-- SOLUTION: Script -->
<p>
<li>What is the difference between these two expressions?  Answer in 
English AND by providing an example of what each can match.
<pre>
glob:Aa?BC
regexp:Aa?BC
</pre>
<!-- SOLUTION: The glob pattern matches strings of five characters:
A, a, any character, B, C.  The regexp pattern matches only two strings:
AaBC or ABC.  The "?" in globbing means any single character.  The "?" in
regular expressions is a quantifier meaning 0 or 1 of the preceding character.
-->
<p>
<li>What extension does a SIDE user extensions file have?
<!-- SOLUTION: .js (JavaScript) -->
<p>
<li>Where does one start (on the SIDE UI) when one wants to add a new
user extensions file?
<!-- SOLUTION: Options menu -->
<p>
<li>What critical step must be done after including a new user extensions
file in SIDE?
<!-- SOLUTION:  Restarting SIDE -->
<p>
<li>What critical step must be done after making a change to an already-installed
user extensions file in SIDE?
<!-- SOLUTION:  Restarting SIDE -->
<p>
<li>What type of command
argument requires that the <b>javascript{}</b> syntax NOT be
specified?
<!-- SOLUTION:  script -->
<p>
<li>What is the default strategy for element locators--<b>identifier=</b>,
<b>id=</b>, <b>name=</b>, <b>dom=</b>, <b>xpath=</b>, or <b>link=</b>?
<!-- SOLUTION: identifier= -->
<p>
<li>How can one look at just a small portion of a page's HTML code, a portion
in which one is particularly interested?
<!-- SOLUTION: Select that portion of the rendered page, and then bring
up the context menu's "View Selection Source" entry -->
<p>
<li>What is the difference between what these two <b>xpath</b> expressions
match?  Give specific examples of what each can match.
<pre>
//input[@name='April']
//input[contains(@name,'April')]
</pre>
<!-- SOLUTION: The first one will only match input fields which have a
name attribute equal to 'April' whereas the second will also match input fields
which have names like 'Aprilla' and 'GoodApril' -->
<p>
<li>What does DOM stand for?
<!-- SOLUTION: Document Object Model -->
<p>
<li>Which of the following DOM expressions is better to use, and why?
<pre>
dom=document.forms[3]
dom=document.forms['RoomSearch']
</pre>
<!-- SOLUTION: The second is better because the addition or deletion of
a preceding form on the page would break the first one but not the second one. -->
<p>
<li>If a page contained five forms, what would be the <b>DOM</b> expression
for accessing the third one via an array index?
<!-- SOLUTION: dom=document.forms[2] (JavaScript arrays start with index 0.) -->
<p>
<li>What command can be used to check the value of a particular HTML element's
attribute?
<!-- SOLUTION: verifyAttribute -->
<p>
<li>What are the two ways of matching a left parenthesis in a regular expression?
<!-- SOLUTION: [(] and \( -->
<p>
<li>What are the four ways to specify an <b>option locator</b> for a
<b>select</b>?
<!--SOLUTION: index=, label=, id=, value=  -->
<p>
<li>What <b>xpath</b> locator would one use to specify an anchor with
a <b>title</b> attribute which contained the string <b>last</b>?
<!-- SOLUTION: //a[contains(@title,'last')] -->
<p>
<li>What Selenese command is needed to perform tooltip testing?
<!-- SOLUTION: verifyAttribute -->
