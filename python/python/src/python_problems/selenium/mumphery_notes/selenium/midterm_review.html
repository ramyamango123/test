<font size="+2"><li>What does SIDE stand for?
<!-- SOLUTION:  Selenium Integrated Development Environment -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What is the difference between an <b>assert</b> and a <b>verify</b> with
Selenium commands?
<!-- SOLUTION:  Text execution terminates if an "assert" fails, but keeps
on going to the end of the test if a "verify" fails. --> 
<p>
</p></li>
<p>
</p></li><li>What Selenese command can be used to help debug a regexp?

<!-- SOLUTION:  Firefox -->
<p>
</p></li><li>If a Selenium function requires a <b>script</b> argument, what would
that argument look like in general terms?

prefixes might that argument have?
<!-- SOLUTION:  glob:, regexp:, regexpi:, exact: or (nothing - no prefix) -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What is the regular expression sequence that loosely translates to
"anything or nothing?"
<!-- SOLUTION:  .* -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What is the globbing sequence that loosely translates to "anything or
nothing?
<!-- SOLUTION:  * -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What does a character class for all alphabetic characters and digits
look like in regular expressions?

to a certain point within the test?
<!-- SOLUTION:  A Breakpoint -->

in SIDE indicate?
<!-- SOLUTION:  A Start Point.  The test executes from this command to the end of the test. -->

<!-- SOLUTION:  Either type in "S" or
re-select the Set / Clear Start Point item from the context menu.  -->

</p></li><li>How can one add vertical white space between sections of a single
test?
<!-- SOLUTION:  Go into Table view in SIDE and click on a command, right click and

the command.  Or go into Source view and type in the HTML comments syntax
in the desired location. -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What Selenium functionality uses wildcards?
<!-- SOLUTION:  globbing -->
<p>
</p></li><li>Which wildcards does SIDE support?
<!-- SOLUTION:  ? and * -->

studied?

</p></li><li>What regular expression special character(s) means "any character?"
<!-- SOLUTION:  . -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What distinguishes between an absolute and relative URL in
SIDE?
<!-- SOLUTION:  The absolute pathname has a "http" in front while the relative
pathname does not. -->

from within a JavaScript snippet?
<!-- SOLUTION:  storedVars['count'] -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What Selenese command can be used to display the value of
a variable in the log file, which can be very valuable for debugging?
<!-- SOLUTION:  echo -->
<p>
</p></li><li>If one wanted to display the value of a variable named <b>answer</b>
in the log file,
what would the first argument to the previous command look like?
<!-- SOLUTION:  ${answer}
<p>
</p></li><li>Which Selenium command is used to simulate the entry of
input from the keyboard?
<!-- SOLUTION:  type -->
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Where did the name "Selenium" come from?

makers of the well-known WinRunner tool for testing web pages and applications -->
<p>
</p></li><li>Which Selenium command(s) simulates selecting a link?
<!-- SOLUTION:  click, clickAndWait -->

<!-- SOLUTION:  like this line of code right here -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What is the nature of the bug with the <b>Source</b> view of the SIDE?
<!-- SOLUTION:  If you make modifications in the Source view and do not save the test, then
execute the test, all your modifications will be lost.  -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What are Selenium tests normally named (as displayed at the top
of each test when viewed from within a browser)?
<!-- SOLUTION:  The same as the filename without the .html extension 
Examples, neg-not_enough_params, neg-no_params, pos-course_number --> 
<p>
</p></li><li>What command simulates selecting the browser's <b>Back</b> button?

<!-- SOLUTION: Options=>General=>Record absolute URL -->
<p>
</p></li><li>What Selenese command and argument 
can be used to transfer the value of a JavaScript

where the snippet is an expression that evaluates to the value of the JavaScript
variable of interest -->
<p>
</p></li><li>How would one access the value of a SIDE variable named <b>name</b>
