<p>Use SIDE to automate the Test Case Specification below.
You should create a single test suite, composed of several test cases, one
for each of the individual test cases below.  Note that many of the test cases
contain more than one expected result; for these test cases, it is fine to have the multiple verifications inside a single test case file.
<p>The search string to be used for each test case should appear once and
only once!
You should store the search string's value
in a variable, and use the variable in all future commands that need it.
If you need to modify the search string somewhat for use as a regular
expression, store that modified value in a second variable, and use it
in all future commands that need it.
<p>All test cases should be started from <b>http://www.deanza.edu/searchcenter</b>.
<p><b>HINT:</b>  Test cases #1 and #3 are fairly similar.  Both require
using the flow control extension.  They're also both harder than the other
problems, so I'd suggest doing them <b>last</b>.

<li>Return to the SERP.
<li>See if the title of the target landing page is present on the
SERP (it would be a snippet title if present).  If it is present, that
means the <u>Cached</u> link takes one to <b>one</b> of the hits' URLs, which
gives one reasonable confidence that the <u>Cached</u> links are working.
If the title of the target landing page is not present on the SERP, the
test should fail.
</ol>
<p>
NOTE: It would be better but much harder to iterate through every hit on the
SERP, capturing the title of each, and then seeing if the <u>Cached</u> link led one to a
page with the same title.
