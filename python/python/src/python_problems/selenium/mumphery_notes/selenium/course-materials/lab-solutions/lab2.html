<li>GLOBBING-EXACT-NO_PREFIX-1.1
<p>I think the <b>glob:</b> one is best for the following reasons:
  <ul>
  <li>It's better than its unprefixed functional
equivalent because the <b>glob:</b> prefix adds to the readability of the test case.
  <p>
  <li>It's better than the <b>exact:</b> one because it allows for
minor punctuation and spacing changes to be made between words without
the test case failing.
  </ul>
<p>While it's true that a malicious programmer could insert all sorts of
nasty words between the title words without the <b>glob:</b> test
catching it, that's a <b>corner case</b>.  Our primary focus should be on
creating tests that are as robust as possible, while still checking basic
correctness.
