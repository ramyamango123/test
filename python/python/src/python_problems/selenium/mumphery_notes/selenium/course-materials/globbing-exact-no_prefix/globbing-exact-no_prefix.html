<h2 align="center">Globbing, Exact, and Prefix-Free Patterns</h2>
<p>
<font size=+2>
<ol type=I>
<li><b>Question</b>: When does one use globbing, exact, regular expression (covered
next week), and prefix-free patterns?  
<p><b>Answer</b>:  Whenever the reference documentation for a Selenium
command specifies a <b>pattern</b> argument.
<p><b>Example</b>: <b>verifyTitle</b>
<p>
<li>Globbing
<p>
  <ol type=A>
  <li>Globbing is sometimes called "filename expansion."  
  <p>
  <li>Globbing utilizes "wildcards."
  <p>
  <li>Globbing and regular expressions ARE NOT THE SAME THING!!!
  <p>
  <li>The usual globbing wildcards are:
  <p>
      <ol type=1>
      <li><b>?</b> - matches any single character.  Thus, <b>a?b</b> would match "aXb" or "a b".
      <p>
      <li><b>*</b> - matches anything, including nothing.  Thus, <b>a*b</b> would match:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>ab
        <li>aXb
        <li>a Now is the time for all good women to come to the aid of their countryb
        <li>&lt;an infinite number of other strings&gt;
        </ul>
      <p>
      <li><b>[]</b> - character class, which matches any single character that is included between the brackets.  Thus, <b>[0123456789]</b> would match any digit.  
      <p><b>[abcdefghijjklmnopqrstuvwxyz]</b> would match any lowercase alphabetic character.  
      <p><b>[A-Za-z0-9]</b> would match any alphabetical letter, regardless of case, or any digit.
      </ol>
  <li>To use globbing within a Selenium IDE test, one must prefix a pattern with <b>glob:</b>.
  <p>
  <li>Note that the <a href="http://voyager.deanza.edu/~mam-p/spring_2008/selenium/course-materials/reference.html">Selenium reference docs</a>
  make it sound like only the <b>?</b> and <b>*</b>
  work.  My experiments reveal that this is indeed the class, i.e., character classes are NOT
  supported for <b>glob:</b> patterns.
  <p>
  <li><a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/distribute/May-Pumphrey/SeleniumIDE/globbing-exact-no_prefix/globbing.html">Example</a> 
  </ol>
<p>
<li>exact
<p>
  <ol type=A>
  <li>In addition to regular expressions (<b>regexp:</b>) and globbing (<b>glob:</b>), Selenium
also supports <b>exact:</b> matching with pattern arguments.
  <p>
  <li><a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/distribute/May-Pumphrey/SeleniumIDE/globbing-exact-no_prefix/exact.html">Example</a>
  </ol>
<p>
<li>No label prefixing pattern
<p>
  <ol type=A>
  <li>Defaults to <b>glob</b>
  <p>
  <li><a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/distribute/May-Pumphrey/SeleniumIDE/globbing-exact-no_prefix/no-prefix.html">Example</a> (same as used for <b>globbing:</b> with same results)
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE GLOBBING-EXACT-NO_PREFIX-1</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Which of the three <b>verifyTitle</b> tests in this <a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/distribute/May-Pumphrey/SeleniumIDE/globbing-exact-no_prefix/globbing-exact-no_prefix-1.html">example</a> is best?  Why?  Which is worst?  Why?
<p>
<li>Select a link from the <a href="http://www.deanza.edu/directory/dir-az.html">De Anza A-Z Directory</a> for which the target page's title looks like it could be changed at some point in the future.  Create a Selenium IDE test for that link in which you use globbing to make the test as <i>robust</i> as possible.  Be sure to check that the test can also fail when appropriate by making a tiny
change to the title provided in your test.
