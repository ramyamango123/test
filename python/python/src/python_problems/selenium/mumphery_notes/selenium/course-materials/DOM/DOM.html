<h3 align="center">Using the JavaScript DOM to Specify Element Locators</h3>
<font size=+2>
<ol type=I>
<li>DOM = Document Object Model
<p>
<li>Can be used whenever a Selenium command requires an <b>element locator</b> for one
of its arguments.
<p>
<li>Syntax:  <b>dom=<i>dom expression</i></b><br>
or:  <b><i>dom expression</i></b>
<p>
<li><a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/Distribute/May-Pumphrey/SIDE-S2008/DOM/DOM-searchable-schedule.html">Example</a>
  <p>
  <ol type=A>
  <li><b>select</b> takes two arguments:  <b>selectLocator</b> and <b>optionLocator</b>.
  <p>The <b>selectLocator</b> could be any type of <b>Selenium element locator</b>.   However, all of the statements in the example use <b>DOM</b> locators.
  <p>The first group of tests specifies an <b>optionLocator</b> using the 0-based <b>index</b> of the desired <b>option</b>.
  <p>
  <li><b>schsearch</b> is the value of the <b>name</b> attribute for the
second form on the page.  Hence, <b>forms['schsearch']</b> qualifies which
form we wish to access.
  <p>
  <li>Instead of using <b>forms['schsearch']</b>, we can use <b>forms[1]</b> as can be
seen in the second <b>select</b>.
  <p>However, using the array index of an element within a group of elements should only be used
as a last resort!
  <p>
  <li>The cleanest syntax is to just use the form's <b>name</b> attribute
 after <b>document.</b> This can be seen in the third <b>select</b> example.
  <p>
  <li>And the very cleanest is to eliminate the optional <b>dom=</b> label, seen in the fourth <b>select</b> example.
  <p>This works because SIDE assumes that any <b>locator</b> starting with
<b>document</b> is a <b>DOM</b> locator.
  <p>
  <li>The second group of <b>select</b> examples demonstrates the <b>label=</b> and <b>value=</b> methods of specifying an <b>optionLocator</b>.  These refer to the <b>label</b> and <b>value</b> attributes of an <b>option</b> element.
  <p>There's also an <b>id=</b> method for specifying an <b>optionLocator</b>.
  <p>No prefix defaults to <b>label=</b> as can be seen in the second example
of this group.
  <p>
  <li>The third (largest) group of Selenese commands all use the <b>id</b>
attribute of an element within the schsearch form in order to mimic user
actions.
  <p>
  <li>Note the <b>refreshAndWait</b> command at the beginning of the test.
This ensures that despite whatever may have been going on with the SUT
before the test is run, that the form is totally blank when the test actions
begin.
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE DOM-1</b>
<p>Create a test fragment that uses a DOM locator to click on
the <b>Search</b> button underneath <b>Admissions & Registration</b> on
the <a href="http://www.deanza.edu/searchcenter/">De Anza Search Center</a>
page.
<p>All five of the <b>Search</b> buttons have the same <b>name</b> attribute,
which causes SIDE's <b>Record</b> feature to be forced to use a 
DOM locator for the last four.  Because the Admissions & Registration
button is first, SIDE does not have to use a DOM locator for it.
However, a test will be more robust if a DOM locator is specified
even for the Admissions & Registration button.  Why is this?
