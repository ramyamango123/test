<li>Opening a Page: <b>Base URL</b>
  <p>
  <ul type="A">
  <li>Saved as part of test as of 1.0 Beta; was saved in user's cookie in 0.8.
  <p>
  <li>1.0 Beta tests that rely on it are harder to read (because URL to page
being tested is spread across two locations within test program).
  <p>
  <li>Buggy!  For example, changing the <b>Base URL</b> within the <b>Source</b> tab doesn't have any effect on the <b>Base URL</b> displayed at the top of the SIDE GUI.  So one can have two different values on display for <b>Base URL</b> at the same time for the same test!
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Opening a Page: First argument to <b>open</b> command
  <p>
  <ul type="A">
  <li>Can be <b>absolute</b> (complete) URL, e.g.,<br>
  <b>http://www.deanza.edu/directory/dir-az.html</b>
  <p>
  <li>Can be <b>relative</b> (in relation to <b>Base URL</b>), e.g., <br>
  <b>/directory/dir-az.html</b> OR...<br>
  <b>directory/dir-az.html</b>
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Opening a Page:  Issue with Slashes (/)
<p>In 0.8, using a <b>Base URL</b> without a trailing slash, e.g., <br>
<b>http://www.deanza.edu</b><br>
 while also using a <b>relative URL</b> without a leading slash, e.g., 
<b>directory/dir-az.html</b><br>
would result in SIDE not being able to open the page.  
<p>This issue has
been fixed in 1.0 Beta.
<p>
<li>Opening a Page: <b>Options</b>=&gt;<b>Options...</b>=&gt;<b>Record absolute URL</b> checkbox
<p>Affects only what will be put into first argument of <b>open</b> command during recording of a test
<p>
<li>Recommendations:
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Avoid <b>Base URL</b> until such time as you want to help the OpenQA
team get this feature right OR until you have a compelling reason for using it.
  <p>
  <li>Turn <b>Record absolute URL</b> on and leave it on (until you have a
compelling reason for doing otherwise).
  <p>
  <li>Always provide an <b>absolute URL</b> argument to <b>open</b> (unless
you have a compelling reason for doing otherwise).
</ol>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE OPEN-1</b>
<p>Turn on <b>Record absolute URL</b>.  Try recording a simple test to verify
that an <b>absolute URL</b> is being recorded as the first argument to
the <b>open</b> command.
