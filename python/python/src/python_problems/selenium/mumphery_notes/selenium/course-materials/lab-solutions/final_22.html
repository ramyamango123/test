<font size="+1">
<p>Create a single-file SIDE test case for the following test case specification.  When you have finished testing
it, email it to <b>mamp@earthlink.net</b> with a <b>Subject:</b> line of <b>SELENIUM FINAL #22</b>.  You have until midnight tonight to mail it.
<p><b>WARNING: </b>Please be very careful to not accidentally submit the
form with four valid values.  We do not want a host of bogus comments
landing in any campus email-boxes!
<p><b>HINT: </b>This problem is a test of your ability to synthesize what
you've learned in class to research and utilize new (to you) Selenium
functionality.  In other words, you may need to skim through the reference
docs, looking for a needed command or two.
<p><b>REQUIRED: </b>Store your valid values in variables, and access those
variables for each of the four tests.  Do <b>NOT</b> use a literal 
such as a value for the name field more than once.
