<ol type="I">
<li>Executing only a portion of a test
  <p>
  <ol type="A">
  <li>From one command through the end of test...
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>In <b>Command</b> view, select the command where execution should start.
    <p>
    <li>Bring up the Context menu (alt-click for Windows, CTRL-click for Macs).
    <p>
    <li>Select the <b>Set / Clear Start Point</b> item.
    <p>
    <li>Observe the right-pointing green triangle at the beginning of the selected command.
    <p>
    <li>Select the usual glyph ("Play from the beginning or start point") 
        to start playing the test from that command.
    <p>
    <li>To delete the <b>Start Point</b>, either type an "S" OR re-select the <b>Set / Clear Start Point</b> item from the context menu.</ol>
  <p>
  <li>From the beginning through a <b>Breakpoint</b>...
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>In <b>Command</b> view, select the command where execution should end.
    <b>NOTE</b>: Do not select a comment!  SIDE will allow one to set a
    breakpoint at a comment, but it will be a non-functioning breakpoint!
    <p>
    <li>Bring up the Context menu.
    <p>
    <li>Select the <b>Toggle Breakpoint</b> item.
    <p>
    <li>Observe the double yellow vertical lines at the beginning of the
selected command.
    <p>
    <li>Select the usual glyph ("Play from the beginning or start point") 
        to start playing the test from that command.
    <p>
    <li>To delete the <b>Breakpoint</b>, either type a "B" OR re-select the
<b>Toggle Breakpoint</b> item from the context menu.
    </ol>
  <p>
  <li>One command only - Select the <b>Execute this command</b> item from Context menu in <b>Command</b> view.
  </ol>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE GUI-1</b>
<p>Bring up one of your stored tests that contains several commands.  Set a
<b>Breakpoint</b> and then execute the test from the beginning
to that point.  Then try
executing one command only from the test.  (Warning:  Using a <b>Start Point</b>
will be more difficult because the <b>open</b> command will not get executed.)
<li>Stepping through a test's execution
  <p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Select the usual green right-pointing triangle ("Play from the beginning or start point").
  <p>
  <li>Immediately select the <b>Pause</b> glyph (two vertical yellow bars).
  <p>
  <li>Observe that the right-and-down-pointing blue arrow ("Step") has now become
active.
  <p>
  <li>Select this "Step" blue arrow repeatedly in order to step through the execution, one command at a time.
  </ol>
<p>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE GUI-2</b>
<p>Bring up one of your stored tests that contains several commands.  
Execute this test via stepping through it.  
<li>Test names vs. file names
  <p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>The <b>thead</b> portion of each test contains the name of that test.
  <p>
  <li>The default name of a new test is "New Test."
  <p>
  <li>Once a test has been saved, its name becomes the same as the name of that test's
  filename, minus the .html extension.  However!  That change is not visible
  unless the test is reopened or SIDE is closed and then reopened.
  <p>
  <li>Can a user override that name change with a different name change?  Not as far as I can tell!  The name supplied by the user is always overwritten by the
filename minus the .html extension.
  <p>
  </ol>
<p><b>LAB EXERCISE GUI-3</b>
<p>Record a simple test for a single link from the De Anza A-Z directory.
From <b>Source</b> view, change the test name to whatever you wish.  Then
save the test to whatever filename you wish, as long as its basename
 differs from the test name you supplied.  Next, reopen the test.  What
is the test name now?
