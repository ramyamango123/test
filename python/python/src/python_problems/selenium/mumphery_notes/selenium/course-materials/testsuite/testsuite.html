<h2 align="center">Test Suites Using SIDE 1.0 Beta</h2>

<font size=+2>
<ol type=I>
<li>The good news?  Creating and executing a test suite is a 
lot easier in SIDE 1.0 Beta than in SIDE 0.87.
<p>The bad news?  Creating and executing a test suite in SIDE 1.0 Beta is
not quite as easy as the GUI would lead one to believe.
<li>Method-1 (somewhat manual):
<p>
  <ol type=A>
  <p>
  <li>Create an HTML file (outside SIDE, using an editor) 
  with a <b>one-column table</b> in the same directory as the test cases.
  <p>
  <li>Fill in each cell of the table with a link to a <i>testcase</i>.html file.
  <p><a href="http://puma.deanza.edu/distribute/May-Pumphrey/SIDE-S2008/testsuite/testsuite.html">Sample test suite</a>.  Do a <b>View=>Page Source</b> in order to see the raw HTML needed to create a test suite suitable for
 SIDE.
  <p>
  <li>Select <b>File=>Open Test Suite</b> to open the test suite.
  <p>
  <li>Use the first right-pointing green arrow to execute the test suite.
  </ol>
<p>
<li>Method-2 (more automated):
<p>
  <ol type=A>
  <p>
  <li>Create 3 simple test cases, one after the other, allowing them to
"accumulate" in the <b>Test Case</b> frame on the left of SIDE.
  <p>
  <li>Select <b>File=>Save Test Suite As...</b> to create a test suite that
invokes the three test cases.
  <p>
  <li>Close SIDE and bring it up again (just to prove that your test suite
works).
  <p>
  <li>Select <b>File=>Open Test Suite</b> to open your Method-2 test suite.
  <p>
  <li>Use the first right-pointing green arrow to execute the test suite.
  </ol>
<p>
<li>Method-3 (which doesn't exist as far as I can tell!).  
<p>There ought to be a way to create the one-column table test suite using
<b>Table</b> or <b>Source</b> view.  
<p>However, selecting <b>New Test Suite</b>
just sets one up to create a new test case, allowing one to use <b>Method-2</b>
eventually.
<p>
<li>Method-4 (which doesn't exist either as far as I can tell!).
<p>Once one has created several different test cases, there ought to be a way
to <i>load</i> them into the <b>Test Case</b> frame on the left of SIDE, in
the order that one wants, and then select <b>File=>Save Test Suite As...</b>
to create a test suite that invokes those test cases in the order they appear.
<p>However, selecting <b>Open...</b> to open an existing test case always
removes whatever test cases are already in the <b>Test Case</b> frame on the
left of SIDE.
<p>What does the absence of Method-3 and Method-4 mean with respect to which
of the earlier two methods you'll be using more often?
  <p><b>LAB EXERCISE TESTSUITE-1</b>
  <p>
  <ol>
  <li>Using Selenium IDE and any four links from the De Anza directory 
  you wish, create 
  four separate tests, one per link (as opposed to one test covering
  four links as you did for Lab Assignment-1).  Run each test after you've
  created it to make sure it works.
  <p>
  <li>Create a test suite via <b>Method-1</b> to execute each of your four tests in turn.
  <p>
  <li>Execute your test suite, making sure that all your tests
  pass or fail as expected.
  <p>
  <li>Repeat the three steps above, this time using <b>Method-2</b> to
  create the test suite.
  <p>
  <li>For hand-in purposes, attach one of your two test suites plus the
  individual test cases called by that test suite.
