<h3 align="center">Final Exam</h3>
<font size="+1">
<p>
There are 22 questions on this exam, 21 short-answer and 1 programming.
Your best 20 questions will be graded.  This means that you can do all
22, miss 2, and still get a 100%.  Or you can choose not to do any two
questions (including the programming
problem) if you're short on time and/or long on confidence!
<p>Please keep your short answers <b>short</b> and <b>neat</b>!  Only a
few words are required to answer each question. 
<p>When you have finished the short-answer questions, write
your name at the top of the exam and hand it in to me.  I will hand you
another sheet that contains just question 22.  You can then turn
on your computer and work on that question.
<p>Good luck!
