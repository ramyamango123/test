Tutorial steps completed (after modification):

1.  cd to location of selenium-server.jar file (/home/selenium/selenium/selenium.*9.2)

2.  java -jar selenium-server.jar -interactive

3.  cmd=getNewBrowswerSession&1=*firefox /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.12/firefox-bin&2=http://www.deanza.edu 
Up comes a Firefox browser with TestRunner in the upper panes.

4.  Note down sessionID value.

5.  cmd=open&1=http://www.deanza.edu/schedule/classes/?qttr=W

6.  cmd=type&1=CourseID&2=74&sessionId=368885  <== replace value of sessionId as appropriate

7.  cmd=getTitle&sessionId=368885

8.  cmd=testComplete&sessionId=368885
Down goes the Firefox browser.


Lessons learned:

One has to specify the full path to the firefox *binary* in cmd #3 above.  What did not work?  Assuming that
because the shell from which java was invoked could find firefox in its path, the selenium.sh file would be
able to also!  And...  Putting the path to the firefox *shell* script in the argument to #3 above rather
than the path to the firefox *binary*.  We spent a lot of time figuring out these two matters.


KEY POINTS FROM DISCUSSION WITH MARIE:

1.  We don't think that running Selenium RC on voyager or bugz, and popping up a browser on a Windows desktop is going
to work.

2.  Given #1, the Selenium RC class would have to be taught on either:

--The 10 Linux desktops in the lab.  Marie said they could get me a Linux system for the classroom.  Students
would have to pair up in the lab.

--I'd have to bite the bullet and teach Selenium RC with Perl on Windows desktops.  (A fate worse than death!)

--Eventually, when we have the new machines, we'll probably be using VMWare environments, which would allow me the
platform of my choice!
