<p>
<ul>
<li>Watch instructor
demo of how to use <a href="http://www.browsercam.com">browsercam.com</a>
 for browser-compatibility testing.
<p>
<li>Register for free 24-hour trial at browsercam.com.
<p>
<li>Use the browsercam trial to do browser-compatibility testing
of the area of De Anza's web site which you are covering in your TDS/TCS.
<p>It is probably a better use of your trial's 100 images to use several
URLs with only the most major browser-OS platforms, as De Anza's web team
is not going to be terribly interested in an obscure browser-OS not handling
a page properly.  If the area you are testing does not involve several URLs,
feel free to also test other areas and/or some of the <a href="http://www.spreadelove.com">spreadelove.com</a> pages.
<p>
<li>File a bug for each browser-compatibility problem you find.
<p>
<li>Update your TDS to include one or more test cases that you did using
browsercam.com.  Be sure to specify which browser-OS platforms should be
selected by the tester.
<p>
<li>To hand in this assignment, send the URL of your browsercam Project page to me
at mamp@earthlink.net with a <b>Subject</b> line of 
<b>BROWSERCAM ASSIGNMENT</b>.  Make
sure your real name as it appears in college records is at the top of
the message body.
<p>
<li>Your hand-in assignment does not need to include all 100 images from 
your trial.
