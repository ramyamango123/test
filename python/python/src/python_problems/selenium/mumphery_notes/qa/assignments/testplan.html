<ol>
<li>Write a <b>Test Design Specification</b> for the De Anza page(s)
you've been assigned.  Use the IEEE template on page 184 of your text.

<p>
<li>Create a <b>Test Case Specification</b> spreadsheet similar to that shown on page 191 of your text only with these four column headers:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Test Cases (test case ids from TDS)
<li>Actions (a numbered list of instructions to the tester)
<li>Expected Results (a description of <b>passing</b> results)
<li>Notes (Optional)
<li>Actual Results (Optional!  Filling out this column is the equivalent of
producing a test log or test report, i.e., it's not part of a TCS.)
</ul>
<p>
The spreadsheet should include <b>every</b> test case you've described
in the <b>Test Identification</b> section of your TDS.
<p>The info in the spreadsheet should be much more detailed than the one-line description
of each test case that appears in the <b>Test Identification</b> section
of your TDS document.  The TDS contains high-level descriptions of each
test case, whereas the spreadsheet contains explicit instructions and
detailed descriptions.

<p>To hand in this assignment, you will give me hardcopies on the night
of the due date.  Please staple the pages of each document together, and
then paper-clip (or otherwise attach) the two documents together.
