<p>
The point of this assignment is two-fold:
<p>
<ul>
<li>To give you experience attempting to convince recalcitrant web page owners
to fix problems in their page(s).
<p>
<li>To collectively attempt to clean up De Anza's web site as much as possible.
</ul>
<p>What you need to do for this assignment is: 
<ul>
<li>Contact the owner(s) of De Anza web pages 
with requests to fix whatever bugs you have noted and
filed in our landfill/testopia_tip Bugzilla.  You can make this contact via a phone call, an email, or in
person.  
<p>Note that the above means that you should NOT contact web page owners
regarding bugs filed by other students in the course.  Nor should you contact
web page owners for page(s) assigned to other students in the course
for their test plans.  However, this still leaves you with hundreds of pages
from which to choose, in addition to the page(s) assigned to you for your
own test plan.
<p>
<li>Feel free to Cc: me on messages sent to web page owners or to provide
my contact info to web page owners.  If the web page owners realize you are
making your request as part of an actual course assignment, they may actually
be more responsive than they would be otherwise.
<p>
<li>Document all of your contacts (and results) in an email message sent
to me (mamp@earthlink.net)
no later than Tuesday, March 18th.  The <b>Subject</b> line should be
<b>EXTRA-CREDIT ASSIGNMENT</b>.
Make sure your real name as it appears in college records is at the top of
the write-up.
<p>
<li>You will be graded based on your <i>efforts</i>, not your <i>results</i>.
The assignment will earn between 1 and 5 points to be added to your <i>overall</i>
grade.  For example, if your overall grade was a 79 (C+) and your Extra-Credit
assignment earned the maximum 5 points, your overall grade would then be
raised to an 84 (B).  This is by far the biggest opportunity you're going to
have to earn extra points, so I encourage you to make the most of it!  Go
<b>bug</b> those <b>bug</b>-owners now!  ;-)
</ul>
