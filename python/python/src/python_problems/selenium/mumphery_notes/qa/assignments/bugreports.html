<h2 align="center">Bug Reports Assignment</h2>
<p>You will be creating Bugzilla reports for any (and hopefully all!) bugs
you find throughout
this course.  At the end of the quarter, I will be reviewing all of
those bug reports which are in any state other than CLOSED.  (You may use the
CLOSED state as you would use the "delete" key!)
<p><b>Hand-in instructions:</b>
<ol>
<li>Send an email to mamp@earthlink.net with a Subject line of
BUGZILLA ASSIGNMENT (all caps).
<p>
<li>Put your name as it appears in De Anza College records at the top
of the email message.
<p>
<li>Send URLs as follows...
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>1-3 URLs (from landfill, bugz.deanza.edu, Mozilla/Bugzilla) that together will display your 5 best (non-CLOSED) bugs.  
  <p>
  <li>1-3 URLs (from the same 3 installations as above) that together will display every bug you filed which is in a state other than CLOSED.  
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><b>Required:</b> No bug should be in state RESOLVED other than RESOLVED/LATER!  You must do confirmation testing on each RESOLVED bug
and then move that bug to either REOPENED or VERIFIED, as
appropriate.  Points will be taken off for bugs left in state RESOLVED (other than
RESOLVED/LATER).
