<H3>Text</H3>
<b><i>Systematic Software Testing</b></i> by Rick D. Craig and Stefan Jaskiel, published by Artech House Computer Library.

<p>In order to make our study of the many concepts introduced in
this textbook as engaging as possible, those classes devoted to a chapter of
the book will take a variety of <b><i>formats</i></b>:
<p>
  <ul>
  <p>
  <li>Lecture.  I talk, you ask questions!
  <p>
  <li>Quiz. I ask questions, you answer them.
  <p>
  <li>"Most Important Points Free-for-All."  Each attendee takes a turn
  (3 minutes max) telling the rest of the class some point from 
  the chapter which s/he found the most interesting/useful/important.  (I'll
  record these and then post them on our class web site.)
  <p>
  <li>"Shared Lecturing."  Each of you lectures on a short pre-assigned
  section of the chapter.
  <p>
  <li>"Class Competition."  Although none of these are scheduled, the
instructor may elect to replace a "Most Important Points Free-for-All" or
"Shared Lecturing" event with a competition instead.  In these events, two
or more teams are created, and the material is reviewed via a game-show-style
competition.
  </ul>

<h3>Lab</h3>
<p>This class is a 4-credit lecture-only class in transition to becoming a
4-credit lecture-lab class.  This means we'll be having lab time during:
<ul>
<li>One hour of class time per week (a 4-credit lecture-lab class 
has only 3 hours of lecture, and another 3 hours of lab).
<li>My office hour:  Tuesday, 8:15 - 9:00, ATC-312.
<li>One extra half hour:  Thursday, 8:15 - 8:45, ATC-312.
</ul>
<p>The above plan is just one-half hour short of the lab time that the class will
have once it's officially a 4-credit lecture-lab class.

<h3>Attendance</H3>

<P>Students may be dropped after the third unexcused
absence from class.  But don't count on this happening!  If you need
to disappear from the class, drop it yourself to be safe.</P>

<P>Depending on the grade breakdown, the instructor <I>may</I>
lower the minimum percentage needed for some of these grades.
Do not depend on this happening!</P>

<H3>Cheating</H3>
<p>In the "real world" inhabited by professional QA engineers, the 
more collaboration, the better.  Thus, you are <b>encouraged</b>
to collaborate with your classmates and other acquaintances in order
to help you produce the best work possible on your assignments.  But 
since this is still
an academic setting, your final "hand-in" work must be your own.  
For example, you are encouraged to ask others for feedback on your
test plan.  But the
actual writing and re-writing of the test plan must be done entirely by 
you.  The same is true for your bug reports--gather as much feedback as
you can on the quality of them, but make the actual improvements all by
yourself.  
<P>If somebody else does the actual work handed in or presented, that
will be viewed as an example of cheating, not collaboration.
In addition, the midterm and final exam will be traditional academic 
exams, in 
which <b>any</b> collaboration will be viewed as cheating.
Any student involved in an incident of cheating, even if serving
only to provide work to another student, will be given a grade
of &quot;0&quot; for that assignment or exam. No excuses, no exceptions!</P>
