<li>Attendance sign-in
<p>
<li>My plan for nobody flunking the midterm:  <a href="./midterm.html">PRACTICE EXAM!</a> with <a href="./midterm_solutions.html">SOLUTIONS</a>.  
<p>
I heartily advise taking the practice exam after you've prepared fairly well for
the midterm but well before next Tuesday night.  Then grade your exam using
the SOLUTIONS.  This should give you a fairly good idea of how much more
studying you need to do!

<li>Another of my plans for nobody flunking the midterm:  
<a href="./midterm_story_problems.html">Midterm Practice Story Problems</a>
<p>
<li>Go over solutions to lab exercises from last time.
