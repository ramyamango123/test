<font size=+2>
<ul>
<li>Take a QA course.  (It's unlikely any of your competitors will have
done this, so a course will set you apart from them, plus it should
impress the hiring manager with your sincerity.)
<p>
<li>Learn technical skills relevant to the type of QA job you want.  For
example, a Web-page tester in a Linux environment would most likely
need experience with
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Linux, PHP, and a tool to automate UI tests such
as Selenium, WinRunner, QuickTest Pro, TestComplete, SilkTest, etc.
<p>
<li>Gain real-world experience in the open-source world.  For example, join the
<a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla_QA_Community">Mozilla QA Community</a>.
<p>
<li>Attend meetings of a professional organization, such as the <a href="http://www.ssqa-sv.org/">SSQA</a>.
