<ul>
<li>Hema:  Risk analysis should be done as early as possible in the software
lifecycle.  It is the process of identifying, estimating, and evaluating
risks.
<p>
<li>Japneet:  There are two kinds of risk analysis.
<p>
<li>Kalpana:  The two are software risk analysis and planning risk analysis.
<p>
<li>Ramya: Risk analysis is done by experts from within various groups inside the
organization.
<p>
<li>Michelle: The software risk analysis can be broken down into ten steps:
(1) Brainstorming
(2) Making a list of features
(3) Identifying the likelihood of the risks
(4) Identifying the impact of the risks
(5) Assigning a numerical value to the risks
(6) Computing the risk priority
(7) Review/modify the values
(8) Prioritize the features
(9) Determine the cut line
(10) Consider mitigation
<p>
<li>Amir:  The purpose of brainstorming is to increase the ideas generated by
the group.
<p>
<li>Hema: The purpose of risk analysis is to determine what to test and the
 test priorities.
<p>
<li>Ramya:  Risk analysis will help to identify those components that need to be
tested the most thoroughly.
<p>
<li>Kalpana: Doing a formal risk analysis helps the tester during the
test planning stages.
<p>
<li>Danny:  The point about brainstorming is to generate ideas, NOT to have a
debate.
<p>
<li>Mary Ann:  There's no mention of how to do tie-breaking in the book
for Step 8.
<p>
<li>Mary Ann:  There's a bug in the "Security" row of the table on 
page 45; that row has different content than on page 44.
<p>
<li>Ramya:  Increasing the user-friendliness of a product will increase
the complexity.
<p>
<li>Mary Ann:  Read up on masked defect vs. latent defect!!!
<p>
<li>Danny:  A latent defect is a defect that is present but not visible.
<p>
<li>Mary Ann:  A masked defect is one that is hiding behind another defect.
<p>
<li>Mary Ann:  How does one do step 6?  Multiply the number assigned to
the impact by the number assigned to the likelihood.
<p>
<li>Pareto Principle:  80% of the contribution comes from 20% of the
contributors.  In software defect terms, 20% of the modules contribute
80% of the defects.
