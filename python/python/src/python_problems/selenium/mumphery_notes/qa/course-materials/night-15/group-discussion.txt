1.  Better integration with defect-tracking
system.

2.  Better sorting functionality than a table.

3.  Attachments are useful.

4.  Manager can see status of test cases in run 
as results are recorded.

5.  Dev can start looking into problematic areas
as soon as a trend is noticed in the results.

6.  Versioning is free/easy with a tool.  (Keeping
zillions of softcopy tables around creates an
issue.)
