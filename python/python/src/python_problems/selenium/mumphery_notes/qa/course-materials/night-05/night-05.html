  <ul>
  <li>File at least one totally new bug (in <b>Software Quality Assurance Class - Spring 2008</b> classification)!  
  <p>
  <li>Set up at least one product and one component.  Avoid setting up
duplicate products and components!
  <p>
  <li>Find a RESOLVED (but not yet VERIFIED) bug report about a De Anza 
  issue, test the fix, and move the bug to VERIFIED or REOPENED accordingly.
  <p>
  <li>Find a bug report about a De Anza issue, a bug report which has not
yet been RESOLVED and one which is not assigned to the "QA Team" (De Anza's
web team, in actuality).  Assign that bug to yourself, then start tracking
down the page owner and asking him or her to fix the bug.  Keep a log of
all such actions so you can write up a summary of them for your <b>Extra-Credit
Project</b> at the end of the quarter.
