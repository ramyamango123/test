<ol>
<li>Do a search for all test runs, and then select the id link for the one
you wish to update.
<p>
<li>Select the <b>View All</b> link to see all the test cases in a scrolling
list.
<p>
<li>Select the table row for an individual test (not the test case's <b>id</b> field).
<p>
<li>Select the <b>Mark as PASSED</b> or <b>Mark as FAILED</b>
icon as appropriate for each test which has
been executed, adding comments via the <b>Notes</b> tab and/or
attaching bugs via the <b>Bugs</b> tab.

<b>NOTES</b> 
<ul>
<li>Not all the results have to be entered at once!  A few can
be entered, and then this process can be continued again later.
The only difference between the initial update and later ones will be that
later sessions will already show status for those tests which have been updated.
<p>
<li>Results can be changed if you discover you've made a mistake on a test's
status.  Simply return to the test run, expand the test case for which the
mistake was made, and correct it.
</ul>
