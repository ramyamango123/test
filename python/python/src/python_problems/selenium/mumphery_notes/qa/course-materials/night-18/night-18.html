<li>Testopia issues from last class:
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>I filed a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437284">bug</a> about the usability issue involved with
creating a Saved Search.
  <p>
  <li>I learned from Greg Hendricks (Testopia PL) that one <b>can</b>
delete a test plan, but only from within the individual test
plan view.  (Look for the red <b>X</b>.)
  <p>
  <li>I determined how to copy a test case from one plan to another:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Bring up the individual test plan which has the test cases you wish to copy to another test plan.
    <p>
    <li>Select the <b>Test Cases</b> tab.
    <p>
    <li>Select the test cases you wish to copy.
    <p>
    <li>Bring  up the context menu and select the <b>Copy or Link Selected Test Cases to Plan(s)...</b> option.
    <p>
    <li>Select the destination test plan(s).
    <p>
    <li>Select the <b>Create a copy</b> link.
    <p>
    <li>Select the <b>Submit</b> button.
    <p>
    <li>View new test case id in confirmation pop-up.
    </ul>
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Any questions on Testopia assignment?
<p>
<li>Any questions about Chapter 9 before the quiz?  
<p>
<li>Quiz!  
<p>
<li>Go over answers to <a href="./quiz-3.html">quiz</a>.  (Do a 
View=>Page Source from Firefox, then look for the answer to each question
in an HTML comment immediately below it.)
<p>
<li>Go over lab exercises from last time.
<p>
<li>Lab:  Continue working on <a href="../../assignments/testopia.html">Testopia assignment</a>.
