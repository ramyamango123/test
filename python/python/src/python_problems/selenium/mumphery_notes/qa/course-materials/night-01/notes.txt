================================================

Benefits of the new Testopia plan:

+ Students get real-world experience, i.e., bugs
you file will get responded to and in some cases,
fixed.  This will allow you to formally test bug
fixes and move bug reports to REOPENED or VERIFIED.

+ Greg gets free testing assistance!

+ Mary Ann doesn't have to deal with De Anza
staffers installing/maintaining Bugzilla/Testopia.
We're using a brand new installation of Testopia's
"tip" for this class.
