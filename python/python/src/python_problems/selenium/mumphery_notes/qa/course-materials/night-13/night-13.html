<li>Sign attendance sheet.
<p>
<li><b>Thursday, 05/22:</b> Peer review of TDS/TCS documents.  Bring
a single hardcopy of each to class!
<p>
<li>Due to this morning's database fiasco, the testopia module has been 
moved out to 05/22 and 05/27.
<p>
<li>The guest speakers originally planned for 05/27 have been replaced
with a module on browser compatibility testing.  And because our
testopia_tip database has still not been restored, we're doing that
browser compatibility testing module tonight!
<p>
<li>Do a <b>Refresh</b> on my greensheet page to see all these changes presented
in an orderly fashion!
<p>
<li>
The 5% of your grade that was to have been based on the
