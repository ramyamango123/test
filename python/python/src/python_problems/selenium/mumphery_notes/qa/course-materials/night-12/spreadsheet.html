<p><b>NOTE to CIS-74 Students:</b>  Only test cases 1, 2, 3, and 15 below
are "finished."  The rest of them are merely reformatted items from the
<a href="./tds.html">Test Design Specification</a>.  In order to finish
this "assignment," I would have to flesh out the actions 
for all remaining test cases, plus add detailed <b>Expected Results</b>
for those same test cases.
