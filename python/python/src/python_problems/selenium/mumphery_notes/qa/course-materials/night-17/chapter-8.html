management.  He or she selects the testers late in the cycle from wherever
they can be found.  Hence, the volunteers rarely have proper testing

the number of body-present hours.

  <ul>
  <li>No communication problems between developers and testers.
  <li>They have superior knowledge of the design and code.
  </ul>

<li>Derrick:  A downside of developers doing the testing is that they
don't always know the business requirements.
