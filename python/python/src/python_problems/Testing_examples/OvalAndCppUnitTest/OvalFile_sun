 Standard OVAL environment to run test programs

 For the diff command,define single lines to 
 compare, through a Perl regular expression. Oval
 will find lines with "OVAL", but can be changed.

  Here we define a new environment
<environment name=StandardOval-0>
  Here we overwrite the default building Oval procedure with SCRAM 
  and we use simple the g++ compiler

<bin name="Prog2.cpp"> Here I put documentation </bin>

<environment name=IntegrationWithCppUnit>
  OVAL environment to integrate CppUnit test
  programs. The driver CppUnit test program out-
  puts [OVAL] Cppunit-result = 1 if one test 
  failed. To build the CppUnit test program Oval 
  will call a Makefile. Don't forget to setup
  correctly the include and lib paths for CppUnit
  calling the startup_rh73_gcc32.csh script at 
  the run time.  
<instructions build="make  %s" 
 cshruntime="echo 'source ../startup_rh73_gcc32.csh'" 
 shruntime="echo">
<bin name="FirstCppUnitTest_TDCppUnit.cpp"> </bin>
</environment>

  Here we define a new environment because we want to run 
  the same executable several times with different args and 
  each time in a different environment.
