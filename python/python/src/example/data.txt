A tree is a perennial woody plant. It most often has many secondary branches 
supported clear of the ground by a single main stem or trunk.
 Compared with most other plants, trees are long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old 
growing up to 115 m (379 ft) tall. Trees have been in existence on the Earth for 370 million years 
and are found growing almost everywhere from the Arctic to the equator. 
Trees are not a taxonomic group but are a number of plant species that have independently 
adopted a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants in full sunlight.
